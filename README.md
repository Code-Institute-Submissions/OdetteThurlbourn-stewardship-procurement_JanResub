#### Page Navigation

- Our navigation layout remains simple and user friendly, the user can visually assertain which page is active by the use of a different colour-way of tat of the main background.  This is also apparent when hovering over the navigation bar icons, the color-way chamges again, however only for the duration of the action of hovering taking place.

#### Footer

- As we pride ourselves in sleek and elegant page layouts, this also goes for our social meadia presence, hence hwy we are only visiable on Instagram and Pintrest. 
We wanted the footer to remain classic with a hint of color when hovered over; for this splash we chose:

*#B74803*

- This paired nicely with the main page background:

 *#27160d*
