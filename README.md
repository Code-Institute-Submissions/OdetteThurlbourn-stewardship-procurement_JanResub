#### Page Navigation

- Our navigation layout remains simple and user friendly, the user can visually assertain which page is active by the use of a different colour-way of tat of the main background.  This is also apparent when hovering over the navigation bar icons, the color-way chamges again, however only for the duration of the action of hovering taking place.
