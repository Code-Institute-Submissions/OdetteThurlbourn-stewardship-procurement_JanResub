# User Features
________________________________________

As this website is only a way for clients to get in touch regarding our services to take on a project, the user is only presented with a basic layout. We do not sell products through the website and only require the client to get in touch via our 'Contact' page to establish initial contact through which we will reach out to said client to start a dialogue to find out the initial needs of the client and their project.  

#### Background image

 - The website hopes to make an aesthetically pleasing impact with its first image of a port side view into a superyacht. Setting the tone that we deal with high net worth individuals (HNWI) and offer a luxury service.

#### Color Combination

- The choice of color combinations were choosen from an image that was placed through a simple 'Pick Color From Image' rendering website namely, https://imagecolorpicker.com/en

   - Headings, navigation fonts and home page paragraph background 
  
  *#ece1d3*

   - Navigation bar background, h2 heading background and contact page h3 heading background 
  
  *#27160d*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813066-96346903-34f1-4480-935f-746ef8482c81.png)

  - Navigation bar background, h2 heading background and contact page h3 heading background 
  
  *#5f3d23*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 115702](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813173-1caab7ea-3958-4b46-bd16-ff11cbba150b.png)
  
  - Extra pop of color for navigation bar and homepage paragraph
  
  *#B74803*
![footer-color-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812777-8fae6714-8f02-46bf-b7d5-95849843a1ed.png)



#### Page Navigation

- Our navigation layout remains simple and user friendly. The user can visually assertain which page is active by the use of a different color-way of the main background. This is also apparent when hovering over the navigation bar icons.The color-way changes again however,  only for the duration of the action of hovering taking place. 


![Nav](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/194095163-c62c1bc8-fde4-49d5-bdfc-0c862565641f.png)


#### Footer

- As we pride ourselves in sleek and elegant page layouts, this also goes for our social media presence hence why we are only visiable on Instagram and Pinterest. 
We wanted the footer to remain classic with a hint of color when hovered over; for this splash we chose:

*#B74803*
![footer-color-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812777-8fae6714-8f02-46bf-b7d5-95849843a1ed.png)

- This paired nicely with the main page background:

 *#27160d*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813066-96346903-34f1-4480-935f-746ef8482c81.png)

- And using the same font-color as seen throughout the layout:

 *#ece1d3*
 ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120055](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812911-fe2fe58e-a561-4d24-a95d-52e37d43c3cb.png)
 
 
 #### Gallery Page
 
 - As our business does not sell products, we like to showcase a few pieces and projects for the client to get an idea or a rough guide of what beautiful pieces are available to them. We've had clients in the past who have based their whole project on one inspirational image alone. Much like we have done with the color combination of this website.

#### Contact Page

- As we pride ourselves on privacy and exclusivity, we aim to make our clients feel special.
Our contact page is simple and to the point, we do all the leg work and only need the client to reach out initally before we set up a client profile, and dedicate a client liasion to look after said client throughout the project process. 

   - As our client base is international, we only require a name and an email address for inital contact.
   - All relevant information will be recorded on the first meeting.

# Testing
________________________________________

#### Webpage Platforms

The website testing was carried out on the following platforms: 
1. Google Chrome
2. FireFox
3. Safari

- Outcome - The website preformed as expected on the three different platforms.

#### Responsivness

The website tested as expected using an array of dimensions namely:
1. Iphone 12 Pro (390px x 844px)
2. Ipad Air (820px x 1180px)
3. Galaxy Fold (280px x 653px)

- Outcome - The website preformed as expected, however we found on the 280px x 653px, the gallery was slightly distored.
- Debug - Look into media query regarding gallery on smaller screen responses.

#### Social Media Links

All social media links were tested and preformed as expected. 

#### Form Entry Requirements

- Form was tested and responded as expected, email is required along with name and surname.
- The form method is set to "POST" and the action pushed the form to a formdump - https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/.


# Bugs
__________________


- The gallery proved to be a challenging element as the images were not responding to code instruction to appear the same width and height - this was corrected by using the 'Love Running' gallery layout and setting "clear" to both.

- The footer was set to "relative" in place of "absolute" to keep the footer at the bottom of the page throughout responsive testing.

- The "hero-image" width was a prpblem as it was not responding to cover the entire page, this was solved by setting the width and the max-height.


# Validator Testing 
____________________

#### HTML

- No errors returned from testing. 

![htmlValidator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/194087938-c4b13975-ac93-43fc-b47b-a90907d7e285.png)

#### CSS

- No errors returned from testing.

#### Accessibility

- Preformance of the site is not strong due to:
1. Image sizes
2. Images not compressed enough
3. Hero-Image does not have explicit width and height property - 
    .hero-img {
    width: 100%;
    max-height: 70vh;
