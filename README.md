#### Page Navigation

- Our navigation layout remains simple and user friendly, the user can visually assertain which page is active by the use of a different colour-way of tat of the main background.  This is also apparent when hovering over the navigation bar icons, the color-way chamges again, however only for the duration of the action of hovering taking place. 

![nav-bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193804563-6a4ca5bc-a2e7-4b74-9256-db9272bc7cda.png)


#### Footer

- As we pride ourselves in sleek and elegant page layouts, this also goes for our social meadia presence, hence hwy we are only visiable on Instagram and Pintrest. 
We wanted the footer to remain classic with a hint of color when hovered over; for this splash we chose:

*#B74803*
![footer-color-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812777-8fae6714-8f02-46bf-b7d5-95849843a1ed.png)

- This paired nicely with the main page background:

 *#27160d*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813066-96346903-34f1-4480-935f-746ef8482c81.png)

- And using the same font-color as seen throughout the layout:

 *#ece1d3*

 #### Gallery Page
 
 - As our business does not sell products per say, we like to showcase a few pieces and projects for the lient to get an idea or a rough guide of what beautiful peiecs are available to them. Have had clients who have based thier whole project on one inspirational image alone.  Much like we have done with t he color combination of this website.

#### Contact Page

- As we pride ourselves on privacy and exclusivity, we aim to make out clients feel special.
Our contact page is simple and to the point, we do all the leg work and only need the client to reach out initally before we set up a client profile and dedicate a client liasion to look after said client thought the project process. 

   - As out client base is international, we only require a name and an email address for inital contact.
   - All relevant information will be taken on the first meeting.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
