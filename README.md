# User Features
________________________________________

Our website serves as the primary point of contact for potential clients seeking to engage our services for their project needs. The layout of the website is streamlined and user-friendly, as we do not offer any products for sale. To initiate the process, we invite clients to reach out to us through the use of a prominent 'Click Here!' button located on the homepage. This will lead them to the 'Contact' page, where they can discuss their project requirements in greater detail and establish a mutual understanding of their needs with our team.
#### Background image

 - The website aims to make a visually striking impression through the use of an image of a port side view of a superyacht on the homepage. This image serves to convey the high-end, luxury nature of our services, and the fact that we cater to high net worth individuals (HNWI).

   - Navigation bar background, h2 heading background and contact page heading background 
  
  *#27160d*

  - Navigation bar background, h2 heading background and contact page heading background 
  
  *#5f3d23*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 115702](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813173-1caab7ea-3958-4b46-bd16-ff11cbba150b.png)
  
  - Extra pop of color for navigation bar and homepage paragraph
  
  *#B74803*
![footer-color-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812777-8fae6714-8f02-46bf-b7d5-95849843a1ed.png)



#### Page Navigation

- Our navigation design is characterized by its simplicity and ease of use for the user. The active page can be easily identified through the use of distinct color variations on the main background. This feature is also evident when the user hovers over the navigation bar icons, as the color scheme changes temporarily during the hover action. 


![Nav](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/194095163-c62c1bc8-fde4-49d5-bdfc-0c862565641f.png)


#### Footer

- As we pride ourselves in sleek and elegant page layouts, this also applies to our social media presence, which is why we have chosen to be visible only on Instagram and Pinterest.
Our footer is designed to remain classic with a hint of color when hovered over. The color scheme chosen for this accent is:

*#B74803*
![footer-color-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812777-8fae6714-8f02-46bf-b7d5-95849843a1ed.png)

- This paired nicely with the main page background:

 *#27160d*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813066-96346903-34f1-4480-935f-746ef8482c81.png)

- And using the same font-color as seen throughout the layout:

 *#ece1d3*
 ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120055](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812911-fe2fe58e-a561-4d24-a95d-52e37d43c3cb.png)
 
 
 #### Gallery Page
 
 - As our business does not sell products, we prefer to showcase a few pieces and projects for clients to get an idea or rough guide of the beautiful pieces available to them. We have had clients in the past who have based their entire project on one inspirational image alone. Similarly, we have used a specific color combination for this website as an inspiration for our clients. 

![gallery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/194310063-6d9034c4-d374-4a48-b275-6ede08509a55.png)


#### Contact Page

- As we pride ourselves on privacy and exclusivity, we aim to make our clients feel special.
Our contact page is simple and straightforward, we handle all the necessary steps and only require the client to reach out initially before we set up a client profile and dedicate a client liaison to look after the client throughout the project process.

   - As our client base is international, we only require a name and an email address for inital contact.
   - All relevant information will be recorded on the first meeting.

# Testing
________________________________________

#### Webpage Platforms

The website testing was carried out on the following platforms: 
1. Google Chrome
2. FireFox
3. Safari

- Outcome - The website preformed as expected on the three different platforms.

#### Responsivness

The website tested as expected using an array of dimensions namely:
1. Iphone 12 Pro (390px x 844px)
2. Ipad Air (820px x 1180px)
3. Galaxy Fold (280px x 653px)

- Outcome - The website preformed as expected, however we found on the 280px x 653px, the gallery was slightly distorted.
- Debug - Look into media query regarding gallery on smaller screen responses.

#### Social Media Links

All social media links were tested and preformed as expected. 

#### Form Entry Requirements

- Form was tested and responded as expected, email is required along with name and surname.
- The form method is set to "POST" and the action pushed the form to a formdump - https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/.


# Bugs
__________________


- The gallery proved to be a challenging element as the images were not responding to code instruction to appear the same width and height - this was corrected by using the 'Love Running' gallery layout and setting "clear" to both.

- The footer was set to "relative" in place of "absolute" to keep the footer at the bottom of the page throughout responsive testing.

- The "hero-image" width was a problem as it was not responding to cover the entire page, this was solved by setting the width and the max-height.
