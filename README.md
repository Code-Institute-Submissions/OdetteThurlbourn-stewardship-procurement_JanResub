#### Page Navigation

- Our navigation layout remains simple and user friendly, the user can visually assertain which page is active by the use of a different colour-way of tat of the main background.  This is also apparent when hovering over the navigation bar icons, the color-way chamges again, however only for the duration of the action of hovering taking place.

#### Footer

- As we pride ourselves in sleek and elegant page layouts, this also goes for our social meadia presence, hence hwy we are only visiable on Instagram and Pintrest. 
We wanted the footer to remain classic with a hint of color when hovered over; for this splash we chose:

*#B74803*
![footer-color-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193812777-8fae6714-8f02-46bf-b7d5-95849843a1ed.png)

- This paired nicely with the main page background:

 *#27160d*
  ![Screenshot 2022-10-04 120002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108287233/193813066-96346903-34f1-4480-935f-746ef8482c81.png)

- And using the same font-color as seen throughout the layout:

 *#ece1d3*

 #### Gallery Page
 
 - As our business does not sell products per say, we like to showcase a few pieces and projects for the lient to get an idea or a rough guide of what beautiful peiecs are available to them. Have had clients who have based thier whole project on one inspirational image alone.  Much like we have done with t he color combination of this website.

#### Contact Page

- As we pride ourselves on privacy and exclusivity, we aim to make out clients feel special.
Our contact page is simple and to the point, we do all the leg work and only need the client to reach out initally before we set up a client profile and dedicate a client liasion to look after said client thought the project process. 

   - As out client base is international, we only require a name and an email address for inital contact.
   - All relevant information will be taken on the first meeting.
